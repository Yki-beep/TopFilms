                                initially mixed, in later years reception has been generally positive, with praise for
                                its cast, humor, and music. Home Alone grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the

                                significant". A sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, was released in 1992.</p>

                            <p class="about">How to Train Your Dragon is a British/American media franchise from
                                DreamWorks Animation and loosely based on the eponymous book series of the same name by
                                British author Cressida Cowell. It consists of three feature films: How to Train Your
                                Dragon (2010), How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014), and How to Train Your Dragon: The
                                Hidden World (2019). The franchise also contains five short films: Legend of the
                                Boneknapper Dragon (2010), Book of Dragons (2011), Gift of the Night Fury (2011), Dawn
                                of the Dragon Racers (2014) and How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming and How to Train
                                Your Dragon: Snoggletog Log (both 2019). A live-action remake of the first film is
                                scheduled for release by Universal Pictures in June 2025.</p>
                            <p class="plot">The franchise primarily follows the adventures of a young Viking named
                                Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, son of Stoick the Vast, leader
                                of the Viking island of Berk. Although initially dismissed as a clumsy and underweight
                                misfit, he soon becomes renowned as a courageous dragons expert, alongside Toothless, a
                                member of the rare Night Fury breed as his flying mount and closest companion. Together
                                with his friends, he manages the village's allied dragon population in defense of his
                                home as leader of a flying corps of dragon riders. Upon becoming leaders of their kind,
                                Hiccup and Toothless are forced to make choices that will truly ensure peace between
                                people and dragons. Dean DeBlois, the director of the film trilogy, described its story
                                as "Hiccup's coming of age", taking place across a span of five years between the first
                                and second film, and a year between the second and third film.</p>

                                Coraline by Neil Gaiman. Produced by Laika, as the studio's first feature film. Just
                                as Gaiman was finishing his novella, he met Selick and invited him to make a film
                                adaptation, as Gaiman was a fan of Selick's other stop-motion works, The Nightmare
