                                initially mixed, in later years reception has been generally positive, with praise for
                                its cast, humor, and music. Home Alone grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the
                                second-highest-grossing film of 1990. It made Culkin a child star, and was the

                                significant". A sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, was released in 1992.</p>
